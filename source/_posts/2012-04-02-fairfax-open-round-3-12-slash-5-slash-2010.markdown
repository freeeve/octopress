I was black this game. I haven't played against 1. c4 very much at all, so it was interesting to see in a tournament setting. It became even more interesting when it turned into sort of a gambit as white gives up a pawn to put on some queenside pressure. Crafty says I should have moved 7. ... Bf4 as soon as he moved 7. Qc2, rather than waiting a move with 7. ... a6. I moved a6 because I saw where 8. Nxb5 cxb5 was leading, and I didn't like it, so I wanted to defend b5 again. However, Bf5 would have accomplished the same thing. I liked the fact that his knight was going to be stuck on a3 for quite some time with this arrangement, save moving twice to get out to c3.

I let it turn into a pretty tactical game by trading white squared bishops and opening the queensides up. There was often only one correct move, with several options proving to be very bad news for either side. After 10. ... Bxc3, the sequence of best moves was pretty clear: 11. Bxc6+ Kf8 (anything other than Kf8 is probably going to hang a piece or lose an exchange), followed by 12. Rd1, which plans to trap my bishop on d3, depending on how it goes, but 12. ... Qc7 offers to trade bishops, and ends the tactics. Crafty didn't like Bxc3,  instead opting for the more cautious Bd7, allowing me the option to castle in a couple of moves--and I think in hindsight that probably would have been better, although it would have let to a much less exciting game.

The main issue for me in the middle game was that it was really hard to develop my kingside knight and rook, since I made it so I couldn't castle kingside. I was trying to leave tactics open, but I couldn't leave my back row undefended, because of the mate threat, which eventually caused me to move 16. ... Bf6. Crafty labeled 17. Be3 as losing another pawn, although the following sequence was pretty tricky, and I messed it up in the tournament. Initially, after 20. ... Ra8, I had thought to take the knight, but I sort of hurriedly took the rook on the back row, hoping to win an exchange and a minor piece. In the end, it basically evens the exchange and leaves white with a passed pawn on a2. After that I blundered a couple more moves before resigning.

Instead of 21. ... Bxa1, I should have taken the knight: 21. ... Bxa3, which leads to 22. Rd3! (threatening 23. Bh3+ taking the queen, and also 23. Rxa3, which can't be taken back because of the same Qb8+ combo before). However, 22. ... Qf5! is the way out, which offers a queen trade, and removes both threats at the same time. Crafty thought 20. Rd3 earlier on was a better move for white, rather than Qxa6. But, Qxa6 was a bit more sneaky, knowing that Rxa3 is a bad idea while the king is still on the back row.
