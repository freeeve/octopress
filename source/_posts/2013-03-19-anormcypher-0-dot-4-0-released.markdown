Thanks to [Julien](http://www.twitter.com/JSirocchi), we now have version 0.4 published with scala 2.10 support!

[AnormCypher](http://anormcypher.org/) is a Cypher-oriented Scala library for Neo4j Server (REST). The goal is to provide a great API for calling arbitrary Cypher and parsing out results, with an API inspired by Anorm from the Play! Framework.

### 0.4.0 changes:

* Scala 2.10
* play-json

### Roadmap:

- 0.5.0: Scala 2.10 Future/Stream non-blocking support
- 0.6.0: Cake pattern with pluggable interfaces for different protocols, REST batch API
