Me playing black.

My opponent's first mistake was letting me take the Bishop on c4.
I was a little worried about that move--spent about 30 minutes thinking of lines that 
involved his queen taking my rook (after he moved Bb3), but me [possibly] eventually
 being able to trap the queen there, if he decided to take that route. 

My goal with b5 was to fork two pieces--the knight and the bishop. After that he missed a minor piece that I was still attacking. I proceeded to trade down until we got to the endgame with me up a rook and a knight.
