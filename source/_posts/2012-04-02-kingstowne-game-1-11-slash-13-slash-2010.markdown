Me as black again. I managed to get 3 solid traps in this game--allowing a pawn to be taken to win a knight and a bishop, and then a nice royal fork with a knight/bishop. A more experienced player probably wouldn't have gone for them. Crafty didn't like my opening starting with c5. I'll try to remember that.
