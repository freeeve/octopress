I was black this game. The opening didn't work out very well for me, as I let my queen get chased around without developing a lot of my minor pieces. On move 8, Crafty says I should have castled instead of trying to chase away the knight. I saw the immediate threat of something like e5 (chasing my knight away), and then Nd5, double attacking the c7 square, so I knew I needed to knock out that knight on b5.

It turns out that 8. ... a6 was a pretty bad move, though, because it opens up for Na7 in a couple of moves. I should have castled instead, removing the threat by other means. 9. Be3 was a good move. Crafty calculated out a fairly long string of tactics where I can trade my queen for two knights if I move 9. ... Qa5. After 10. b4 Qd8 11. Na4 axb5 12. Bb6 Rxa4 13. Bxd8 Nxe4 (sort of forking the rook at a1 and the bishop at d8, but there are some tricky tactics available for both sides). In any case, I didn't play 9. ... Qa5, instead I played 9. ... Qc6, which opened up for 10. Na7, forking the bishop and the queen, and basically forcing the rook to take the knight. If I weren't going to take the knight, I probably would have played 10. ... Qc7 (which is the only way to defend the bishop). That opens up for 11. e5--forcing probably Nh5--and then Nd5, which forces me to do Qxe5 and lose the bishop at c8, or else lose the queen at d8 via Bb6. Luckily, my opponent didn't see Na7, so he moved his knight back 10. Nd4 and kept it fairly even. 

Crafty also pointed out a string of moves starting at 16. Nd5, which apparently wins a pawn over the next 20 moves?? I wonder why my opponent didn't see that one...

My real mistake was 19. ... Bxd5, which opened the pin on my knight immediately. I should have done 19. ... Qd8, moving my queen out of danger and defending my bishop. I didn't see it though--it was only one move deep, too. Just moving too fast in these 20 minute games. I should have just given up my knight--instead I decided to see if he'd make a mistake and move my knight up, giving him my queen. I thought I saw some tactics there, but it didn't work out as I'd planned, and I just resigned after he took my queen and knight.
