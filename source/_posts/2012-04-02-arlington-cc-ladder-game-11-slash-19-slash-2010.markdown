I was black this game. The opening didn't work very well for me--I shouldn't have taken that pawn on b2. My queen got chased around while white develops all his pieces. I'm also almost forced to give up my king's ability to castle. I got lucky several times, but mainly when he made a mistake on move 18, allowing me to semi-fork him. Material is still even until a bit later, but at least that mistake kept me from losing material. His second big mistake seemed to be when he pushed the d pawn, allowing me to take e5. It basically loses the two pawns there, with no gain.

Crafty's analysis:  
4. ... Qa5+ was a mistake on my part. I should have done something safer like Nf6. Score +0.82 instead of +0.27  
8. Rb3 was a minor miss on his part. He should have done Nd5 for a pawn gain after a pretty long chain of moves, also forcing me to lose the ability to castle. Score +0.93 instead of +1.79.  
9. Rb5 was another minor miss--the same long chain is still an option, starting with Nd5. Score +0.71 instead of +1.23.  
9. ... Qa3 was pretty bad on my part. It didn't matter that he had missed the moves, because I went ahead and gave him the c5 pawn. Crafty points out that Qd8 is safer, and eventually gets the pawn back. Score +2.00 instead of +0.71.  
10. ... Kd8. Crafty didn't like this one either. I was trying to prevent Rxc8, but it does seem a little worse looking at it from the response of Bc4. I'm digging myself a hole here. Crafty recommends Na6. Score +2.84 instead of +2.18.  
13. ... Qd6 instead of Qa5. This one loses a piece after 14. Bd5 Nc6 15. Bf4. There aren't really any good moves after that. Crafty recommends 15. ... Bh6, which eventually loses the knight. Score +6.07 instead of +2.30.  
14. Bxa6. Luckily, he didn't see the pseudo queen trap above (winning a minor piece), and exchanged on a6. Whew! Score +2.09 instead of +6.38.  
16. Ng5. Crafty recommends d5 instead. Score +1.50 instead of +2.08.  
18. Rc3 instead of Nf3. This is the move that made me feel like I was getting back into the game (there is a knight sort of hanging on g5), although crafty says I missed an even better move to follow. Score -0.27 instead of +1.42.  
18. ... Nb4 instead of Nc5. Crafty saw that I could win a pawn by trading the knight and bishop for the rook and knight (on g5). Score +1.62 instead of -0.28.  
22. Qc4 instead of Nc7. He sort of drops another piece here by not moving his knight to safety. He's threatening mate if I take the knight immediately, but I can block the path of the queen and rook by putting my knight on c6. Score +0.48 instead of +1.54.  
23. Bxg5 instead of d5. He grabs a pawn, but I can get a pawn too. I missed the best move following this, but it sort of does leave the d4 pawn open for my bishop. Score -1.36 instead of +0.76.  
23. ... Qxa8 instead of Bxd4. I should have taken the d4 pawn right away--that knights not going to go anywhere just yet. Score -0.76 instead of -1.32.  
26. d5 instead of something safer like Be3. This move loses a couple of pawns off the bat. I think his goal was to break up my pawns, but it doesn't get that far with the Nxe5 fork and forcing moves after that. Score -3.56 instead of -0.88.  
29. Qc3 instead of Bxh6. He's digging himself a hole with this move. His bishop is hanging on g5. Score -5.76 instead of -3.69.  
30. Rxe5 instead of Qxe5. Qxe5 kind of forces a queen trade. Rxe5 allows my queen to snag a couple of pawns. Score -8.94 instead of -6.18.  
36. Qb1+ instead of Rh2. Qb1+ looks like it might be drawish--Ke2 Kd1 back and forth. Score +0.01 instead of -8.04.  
37. Kd2 instead of Ke2. He didn't see the draw, so we got to continue. Score -6.89 instead of +0.01.  

It goes downhill pretty fast after this point.
