I'm currently in the process of converting my blog to mongopress (a mongodb alternative to wordpress). I think it is an excellent idea, and even considered writing something myself several times, but I've got a lot on my plate--I was excited when I heard someone had started work on it.

Things I'm looking forward to:

* Wordpress import functionality.
* Comment functionality, although perhaps the disqus service is superior than trying to manage comments yourself anyway.
* non-PHP themes. I've always felt that the theme language for wordpress was overly complex, and designers wrote horrible, unreadable PHP that I've had to support. It would be great (!) to let designers work in just JS/HTML.

The current themes are pretty limited, and the admin UI/installer has some glitches, but for the most part it has been an enjoyable experience--the responsiveness of the pages is noticeable, even on my small blog.
