I was white this game. I've posted crafty's recommended variations in here, highlighted in blue. I played some tricky tactics early in the game, although I didn't quite play them correctly, according to crafty, my opponent didn't see the proper moves to defend.

I missed a killer move 17. Nd5+, which ends up winning a queen and a rook for a knight!

I felt careless in the endgame--he kept getting his pawns back, and my extra knight wasn't helping sitting on a5. It worked out that I was able to get a queen first, regardless, but I could have played it a little more cautiously.

He could have forced me to trade my rook (stopping his queen) for the queen, but he thought he could get my queen with his rook with 54. ... Rc1+, but he didn't see Nc4.
