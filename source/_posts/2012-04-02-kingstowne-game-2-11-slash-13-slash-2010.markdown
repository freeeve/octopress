Me as white. Losing badly out of the opening.

1. ... c5 is one of those moves I really hate to play white against. I'm never sure what to do. Usually I just play Nf3 followed by d4 or c3. I really didn't like the way this opening went. Crafty seemed to think it was ok until 6. Qc3. I kept looking for some tactics that would give me his rook or a minor piece. I think I spent 50 minutes on the first 10 moves. Eventually he gets my e pawn, and I'm left looking for a way to recover, but I make more mistakes on the way. Crafty says I should have done 13. Bb5+ instead of 13. Nd2: the idea being to trade bishops and force either the queen off of the c file, or to pull the knight back. Crafty didn't like 14. Qg3, either, as it blocks one of the escape spots for the bishop. I honestly thought 20. c4 was a fork--I think I needed some food at that point. I started blundering pawns left and right. The game went downhill from there. My opponent did a good job defensively--not leaving any tactics open for me. Eventually he grabbed my knight and bishop, and traded down from there. With all of my pawns on the queenside gone, the game was basically over from here unless he messed up.

Eventually I made a mistake writing down the moves, and I can't reconstruct what happened. I stopped writing when I had 5 minutes left on the clock. He still had about 45. I felt kind of bad that I didn't resign. Instead I made him finish me off.
