My little brother beat me. A good game, although we both made plenty of mistakes.

First serious mistake was his 14. ... Nc6, which basically gives up a bishop for nothing.

Second mistake was my 24. Rxe5 (instead of the Stockfish-recommended 24. Nf5 at a score of ~+19!), which trades down. I was afraid of the knight exposing my queen with a check, so I took him out, but it turns out that I was being paranoid. After 24. Rxe5, Stockfish still gives me a ~+3.

Third mistake was 28. Nf5--I saw some exciting things to do with my knight, and wanted to block the rook up there. But this move was the beginning of my downfall, as it pretty much loses the knight for nothing after Qa1+.

I laid all sorts of traps but my brother didn't fall for them. My final mistake was not seeing the checkmate--should have traded queens or moved my bishop to c2 to block the mate on b2.
