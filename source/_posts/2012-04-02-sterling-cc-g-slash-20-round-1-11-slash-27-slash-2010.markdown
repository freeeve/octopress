I was black this game. I managed to get his rook and two pawns before he tricked me into a mate in 2 with his attack. I actually let crafty play the game through after, one move before the mate in 2, and it ended up a draw after 129 moves, me with an extra pawn and each with a bishop and rook, but the bishops were aligned just right (and were opposite color), so no progress could be made. I think I was up on time by about 6-7 minutes, so maybe I would have survived long enough to win on time, if I had made the right move.

In any case, move 8. Bc3 was the starting point for my advantage. I basically get the two pawns off the bat, and can choose to retreat or try for the tricky tactics involving taking the rook. If I had played properly, crafty says I was 3.91 points up starting at that move, citing these lines:
move made: ({17:-3.91} 8. Bc3 cxd4 9. Bd2 Qxb2 10. O-O d3 11. Nc3 Bxc3 12. Bxc3 Qxc3 13. cxd3 Qe5 14. Qg3 Qxg3 15. fxg3 O-O 16. Rac1 -+)
recommended move for white: ({17:-0.18} 8. Bb3 cxd4 9. Qh3 d6 10. O-O Nc6 11. Qh4 Qd8 12. Qg3 O-O 13. Na3 Kh8 14. Nb5 e5 15. c3 a6 16. Na3 =)

Crafty says I made a mistake taking the rook before pushing the pawn, because 11. Na3 forces me to trade the queen for the 2nd rook, which isn't quite as big an advantage, especially since my pieces are very underdeveloped at this point: 10. ... Qxa1
move made: ({18:-2.21} 10. ... Qxa1 11. Na3 Qb2 12. Rb1 Qxb1+ 13. Nxb1 f6 14. Nh3 O-O 15. Nf4 Nc6 16. Na3 Nf7 17. Qg3 Nce5 18. Bb4 Re8 -+)
recommended move for black: ({18:-3.83} 10. ... d3 11. Qxd3 Qxa1 12. Nc3 Qb2 13. Nb5 Be5 14. c3 a6 15. Rb1 Qxb1+ 16. Qxb1 axb5 17. Qxb5 Nc6 18. f4 Ra5 19. Qb6 d5 20. exd5 exd5 -+)

White had a different plan, though, and it worked on me, so I can't fault him for it: 11. Nc3
move made: ({18:-5.34} 11. Nc3 Qxf1+ 12. Kxf1 dxc3 13. Bxc3 O-O 14. Bxg7 Kxg7 15. e5 Nc6 16. Ne4 Ng8 17. Qg3 f6 18. exf6+ Nxf6 19. Nd6 e5 20. a4 Kh8 -+)
recommended move for white: ({18:-2.02} 11. Qb3 a6 12. Na3 Qxf1+ 13. Bxf1 b5 14. Bb4 Nc6 15. Bc5 f6 16. Nf3 f5 17. exf5 Nxf5 18. g4 Nfe7 19. Qd3 h5 20. g5 -+)

At this point I should have probably taken the trade, because it nets me the knight and two rooks for the queen (which probably would have put me ahead, although it's tricky not having a queen). I was being greedy though: 11. ... Qb2
move made: ({20:-4.36} 11. ... Qb2 12. Nb5 O-O 13. Bb3 a6 14. Bc1 Qxb3 15. Qxb3 axb5 16. Qxb5 Nc6 17. Nf3 d6 18. Qc4 Ng4 19. Bb2 -+)
recommended move for black: ({20:-5.33} 11. ... Qxf1+ 12. Bxf1 dxc3 13. Bxc3 Bxc3 14. Qxc3 O-O 15. e5 Kg7 16. Be2 Nc6 17. g4 Ng8 18. Qc5 Rd8 19. Qd6 Nge7 20. Bf3 h6 21. Ne4 Kh8 -+)

This was a big mistake for me: 12. ... Na6 opens up Nd6+, which is bad news for my kingside. Crafty calculates it as about equal at that point. I saw the threat of Nc7, getting my rook, and Na6 was the only way to prevent that. If I had looked a few moves further, I can force the rook for knight trade, and stay up in material, starting with 12. ... O-O.
({17:-0.51} 12. ... Na6 13. Bc1 Qxc2 14. Nd6+ Ke7 15. Ba3 Be5 16. Ngxf7 Nxf7 17. Qxf7+ Kd8 18. Nb5 Re8 19. Nd6 Kc7 20. Nxe8+ Kb6 21. Rc1 Qxe4 22. Nd6 Qf4 =+)
({17:-4.45} 12. ... O-O 13. Bb3 a6 14. Bc1 Qxb3 15. Qxb3 axb5 16. Qxb5 Rxa2 17. Qb3 Ra6 18. Qg3 d6 19. Ba3 e5 20. f4 Re8 -+)

The game ending mistake was here: 14. ... Rf8--I overlooked Bg5+ which is forced mate in 2. I moved Rf8 really fast, and should have thought about it more. I think I was expecting him to take with his other knight.
({15:Mat02} 14. ... Rf8 15. Bg5+ Bf6 16. Bxf6# +-)
({17:-1.82} 14. ... Nxf7 15. Nxf7 d3 16. e5 Bxe5 17. Nxh8 Bxh8 18. Bxa6 dxc2 19. Rc1 Bc3 20. Qxc3 Qxc3 21. Bxc3 bxa6 22. Bb4+ d6 23. Rxc2 -+)

Crafty ended up a draw after 14. ... Nxf7, but I should have studied 12. ... O-O more--that was a really good move.
