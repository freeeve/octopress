I was black this game. I felt really good about myself [especially because he was rated a few hundred more than me] after seeing 8. ... Nxd4. I didn't imagine that he would let me fork his queen as a result, though. I was planning Nxd4, Qxc1 followed by some checks, or maybe a queen trade, and then Bxe5, pinning the knight to the rook. Things went downhill after the queen fork, which also exposed his king pretty well.
